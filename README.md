# csgocrashedge
This is an old project made in 2021 that I decided to upload here. The goal was to scrape the prior "crashes" on the gambling website WTFskins.com and determine 
if there existed a house edge or a pattern among the distribution of crashes. The results demonstrated that there existed a skewed Gaussian distribution where the mean was located 
at a point which gave the website a 10% house edge, where, with for every dollar gambled, the expected value of return was 90 cents.
